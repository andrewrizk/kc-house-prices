### House Price Prediction in King County, Seattle

In this following practice, we will attempt to predict house prices in King Country in Seattle based on the House Prices Dataset on Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction>. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.

The dataset presents different features of the houses that variably change the predictions. The data will require some work for cleaning and preprocessing to be ready for modeling.

The steps of this practice will involve:
1 - Data cleaning and preprocessing.
2 - Exploratory data analysis.
3 - Feature Engineering: this will involve transforming variables, creating new variables, and eliminating variables in favor of our predictions.
4 - Correlations
5 - Removing Outliers/Scaling/Adjusting Skewness
6 - Modeling:
    a. Linear Regressions
    b. Ridge Regression
    c. Lasso Regression
    d. XGBoost
    e. Random Forest
7 - Model Comparison

* Final model was selected as XGBoost with a MAPE of 0.114
